# PSU_CAPSTONE_F2022
Code repository for Penn State Engineering Capstone Project: Fall 2022

## Overview
This repository contains code and instructions for creating a cloud-controlled IoT traffic light intersection using a [Nordic Semiconductor Thingy:91](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Nordic-Thingy-91), and an [ESP32 based microcontroller from HiLETGo](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-ESP-WROOM-32-Development-Microcontroller-Integrated/dp/B0718T232Z).

The currently provided instructions are for Amazon Web Services, however other cloud providers can be easily used.

## Web Dashboard
A simple React JS single page web app has be created for controlling and viewing the state of the traffic lights.
The code and instructions can be found in the [traffic-light-dashboard](traffic-light-dashboard) folder.

## Thingy:91
The code and instructions for programming the Thingy:91 are located in the `thingy` folder.

## ESP32
The code and instructions for programming the ESP21 are located in the `esp32` folder.
